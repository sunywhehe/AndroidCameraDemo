# AndroidCameraDemo
Learning and using Android cameraï¼ŒModify the official demo to collate code with abstract design

The official demo is very simple, the code structure is not clear, and many functions are put into the same class, so I want to sort out the code structure and make a tool class with camera function

Sorry, I mentioned the interface of camera2 earlier. Now I know that the update of camera x interface is to simplify the API
